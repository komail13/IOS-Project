# IOS-Project
IOS app that presents simple math questions to the user and keeps track of accuracy.

My project is an ios app that enables young kids to practice their mathematical skills. I decided to make it in my mother language, arabic, because I saw that there 
was a lack of apps like my project that were made in arabic. It allows the child to pick between addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. It presents the 
user with random problems that rewards them for ansewring questions right and deducts points for ansewring the question wrong.
